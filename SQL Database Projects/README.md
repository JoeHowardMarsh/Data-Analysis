COVID-Project - Using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
Overview This project looks to organise COVID dataset from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths This data includes infection rates, death rates and vaccinations per country

Motivation and Goals of Project: As this worldwide pandemic isn't going away any time soon, 
I decided to look at some data to get a better overview of how countries are affected by and dealing with this virus.
I wanted to see which countries have been affected the most up to this point and to what degree country's have been able to vaccinate their populations.
